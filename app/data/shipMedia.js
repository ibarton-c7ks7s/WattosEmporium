		description: "The basic TIE starfighter inspired a number of other Imperial starfighters manufactured by Sienar Fleet Systems, which became collectively known as the TIE series. The TIE Line fighter was one of them, and replaced the original model as the standard fleet fighter in the Empire. While the original TIE had performance parity with heavier-built X-wings, the newer TIE/ln boasted improved engines and more powerful weapons, surpassing contemporary Rebel fighters."

		description: "The X-wing is descended from Incom Corporation's Clone Wars-era starfighters, namely the Aggressive ReConnaissance-170 starfighter, Clone Z-95 starfighter, and Z-95 Headhunter. Incom's engineers strove to build a well-rounded, hyperdrive-equipped snubfighter with no exploitable weakness. The new starfighter was intended to become the backbone of the Imperial Navy, but political forces led to the Galactic Empire deciding to rely on Sienar Fleet Systems' more affordable but less capable TIE line. The Alliance to Restore the Republic then adopted the design as its own."

		description: "Produced by Koensayr Manufacturing, these fighters were a mainstay in the Republic Navy during the Clone Wars, becoming an instrumental bomber in the fight against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Y-wings were notably used by Shadow Squadron during the attack on the Separatist heavy cruiser Malevolence. During the Battle of Ryloth, a squadron of Y-wings were used to break the blockade over Ryloth. As noted by AP-5, a Republic analyst droid who helped coordinate the campaign, Y-wings tended to be a bit 'buggy' during atmospheric operations; Clone Captain CT-7567, however, knew the Y-wings to be solid in combat. The light bombers was used to drop an experimental electro-proton bomb on Separatist forces near the end of the Battle of Malastare, completely annihilating the droid army, as well as the being used to bombard entrenched Confederate gunners during the Second Battle of Geonosis."

		description: "The Corellian YT-1300 was utilized as a freighter and transport, and some saw service as intermodal tugs in orbital freight yards. The vessel's side-mounted cockpit and front-facing prongs allowed it to push containers, although the design was modular enough to allow enterprising captains to modify their ships. Standard YT-1300s possessed powerful engines and stock hyperdrives."

		description: "The Lambda-class T-4a shuttle was designed by former Cygnus Spaceworks employees who were lured away by Sienar Fleet Systems, which promised them high salaries, a portion of future profits, and even personal star yachts. Although these shuttles were primarily manufactured by Sienar, Cygnus was subcontracted to build a more heavily armed military version. The T-4a was the immediate successor of the Theta-class T-2c shuttle, and was first introduced in 19 BBY at some point after the Imperial subjugation of Kashyyyk."

They were used by the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire and the subsequent Rebel Alliance, seeing action during the Age of the Empire and the Galactic Civil War. It was still in use thirty years later during the conflict between the Resistance and the First Order."
